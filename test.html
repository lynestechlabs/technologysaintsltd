    <p>development of that industry. The industry has acquired most of its technology through foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade.  Thailand adapted its policies to align with the rapidly changing trends in the global economy. Realizing that its domestic market is small with regard to supporting industrialization, Thailand shifted from an "import-substitution" to an "export-oriented" development strategy. This required liberalization of the economy to promote trade and investments.   The Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand has provided incentives to, and developed support systems for, foreign investors. Some of the incentives provided include low tariffs for imports needed to produce electronic export units, loosening of controls on foreign ownership of firms and provision of essential infrastructure. Liberal economic policies, coupled with the availability of a skilled but low-cost labour force, made Thailand an important location for export-oriented production activities of transnational corporations (TNCs).  Having been established as an important destination for FDI, Thailand attempted to steer the FDI inflows into areas of national priority. The Government designed incentive schemes to channel investments into rural areas and into sectors of importance, such as agriculture and electronics.   In value terms, about $4.5 billion was invested in the electronics industry between 1986 and 2001. FDI continues to play an important role in technology transfer, financing and marketing of electronic products. Trade has also played an important role in the growth of the electronics industry. The industry currently accounts for more than 30 per cent of Thailand's total exports and employs about 300,000 workers. The main export items include hard disk drives (HDD) and parts, and integrated circuits (IC), which account for about 21 per cent and 20 per cent of total electronic exports, respectively. Thailand is the world's second major HDD producer (after Singapore). Despite these successes in attracting FDI and the growth of exports of electronic products, the industry's activities are largely limited to assembly operations. There are indications of growing manufacturing capabilities, but the design and product development skills remain low. For this reason, the current policies of the Government focus on upgrading foreign technologies and promoting novel product development. This could increase Thailand's level of productivity to that of other competing nations.  The Government created several initiatives to promote technology transfer, diffusion and innovation. The National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) established the Industrial Consultancy Services in 1992 to promote the use of local and foreign technical consultants and facilitate the formation of alliances. In 1997, NSTDA set up the Software Park Thailand (SPT) to promote innovation and facilitate development of startup firms. Furthermore, the Board of Investment also developed the Unit for Industrial Transfer of Technology  2 Linkage Development (BUILD) programme to encourage the development of support industries, strengthen linkages and help small and medium-sized contract manufacturers improve their productivity and facilitate cooperation between foreign and domestic firms. It is estimated that about $148 million worth of transactions took place in BUILD in 2001.  These policies have played a vital role in making Thailand a major manufacturer of electronic products and facilitated the acquisition of the skills needed to operate and manage production facilities to assemble intermediate and final electronic products. They have also played an important role in encouraging the development of local contract manufacturers and the transfer and development of technologies. The success stories of domestic companies such as Saim United Hi-Tech Limited, which successfully transformed itself from being a plastic toy manufacturer to being a global supplier of electronic keyboards after licensing technologies from a TNC and innovating further, and the Hana Microelectronics Group, which emerged as a global contract manufacturer of electronics, show the potential of Thai domestic firms in integrating themselves into the global economy. Thailand is now redirecting its efforts to build the capacity needed to operate increasingly sophisticated assembly plants and generate novel processes and products. The initiatives currently being undertaken, such as the development of the Thailand IC Design Incubator and the hard disk drive cluster development project, signal commitment to promoting innovation and technology development in the industry. These initiatives could further ensure that Thailand does not remain a contract manufacturer but gradually moves up the value chain.  Transfer of Technology  3  Introduction Thailand has successfully acquired and adapted foreign technology to build its productive capacity and integrate into the global economy. The Thai economy grew annually at an average rate of between 7.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent during the last four decades. The rapid economic growth played a key role in reducing poverty, and increasing industrial output and exports.  The proportion of the Thai population classified as "poor" declined from about 57 per cent in 1963 to about 16 per cent in 1996 (Khunkitti, 2001). The gross national product (GNP) per capita increased 35-fold between 1961 and 1998. More importantly perhaps, life expectancy has increased from 52 to 69 years, infant mortality has declined almost three-fold and access to safe water has tripled.  These achievements may partly be attributed to the successful transformation of Thailand's economic structure from agriculture to manufacturing. The share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP) declined from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to about 10 per cent in the 1990s, even though the contribution of agriculture to the economy grew steadily by more than 2.5 per cent annually between 1965 and 1996. However, the rapid expansion of the manufacturing sector overshadowed the growth in agriculture (Intarakumnerd et al., 2002). Over the last four decades, the manufacturing sector has contributed significantly to the rapid export growth. The share of manufactured exports as a percentage of total exports increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 74 per cent in 2001 (UNCTAD, 2002). The country's major exports include rubber, textiles, motor vehicles and parts, and electronic products. The electronics industry has been crucial to the growth of manufactured exports. Electronics account for about 30 per cent of total exports. For instance, in 2002, computers and computer parts and integrated circuits (IC) were the top two major export items and accounted for about 11 per cent and 5 per cent of total export value. Currently, Thailand is among the top five major exporters of computer-related products and a major player in the global market for several products, such as hard disk drives (HDD), keyboards and printed circuit boards (PCB). The international competitiveness of the Thai electronics industry has largely been based on successful acquisition and adaptation of foreign technology. Thailand has successfully established and maintained effective access to external sources of technology necessary for building the technical, organizational and management skills needed to produce and distribute products and services efficiently. This has mainly been achieved through appropriate incentives to attract FDI and promote trade.  There are several channels through which technologies may be transferred. However, the commercial transfer of technology at the international level largely takes place through trade, FDI and licensing agreements. These channels are not mutually exclusive. International trade promotes learning through the import of capital goods (e.g. machinery) and intermediate products, and export of technology-intensive products to advanced markets. FDI is an efficient channel for acquiring advanced technologies, as the investor may meet the cost of technology transfer, its adaptation and use. Investors may also introduce new managerial and marketing know-how.  Transfer of Technology  4 Although the mode of entry plays an important role regarding the extent of positive technological spillovers or diffusion to domestic firms, TNCs are likely to transfer sufficient technologies to enable their affiliates to compete successfully in the host economy (UNCTAD, 2000). The technological sophistication of host country firms and consumers, and the level of competition in the host economy may also influence the nature and quantity of technologies transferred through FDI.  Thailand is a good example of a country that has exploited FDI and trade to acquire technology in its quest to industrialize. The country initially provided incentives that encouraged the formation of partnerships during the period of import-substitution policies (1960s). These policies generated only limited FDI flows owing to the limited size of the domestic market. The change of government policies in support of export growth accounted for most of the increase in FDI to Thailand. The country currently imports a significant amount of intermediate products and machinery.  Technological capabilities may be subdivided into four possible layers of skills sophistication. These include skills to use and operate technology, skills to assimilate the acquired technology, skills to upgrade and reverse-engineer foreign technologies, and skills to design and develop novel technologies. The first two are basic and almost all firms possess them. However, only a few firms are able to upgrade and develop novel products. The latter two layers of skills can be built up through learning and accumulation of knowledge over a long period. Thai firms seem to focus on skills needed to operate and adapt foreign technologies. The majority of firms in the electronics industry, including some affiliates of TNCs, use modern equipment and operate state-of-the-art plants. Operational capabilities are important in enabling firms to manufacture or assemble products or offer services efficiently in the short term. They also offer a quicker return on investment than development of novel products and technologies.  Thai domestic firms are largely subcontractors of TNC affiliates. Emerging Thai firms have largely acquired foreign technologies to enable them to produce intermediate products needed by TNC affiliates. As domestic firms in the electronics industry mature from being suppliers to TNCs to original equipment manufacturers, they will require capacity to innovate in order to remain competitive. Thailand is undertaking several initiatives that may facilitate technology development and linkages between public and private sectors, and the Government.  The two firms in this study may be considered frontrunners of such a learning process. They are not representative of most firms in the electronics industry. One firm acquired its technology through licensing, while the other acquired most of its technology by being part of a TNC production network and later through acquisition of firms that owned technologies of interest. Transfer of Technology  5  Chapter I Policies and strategies supporting a competitive electronics industry Over the last four decades, the Government of Thailand has adapted its policies to meet the changes in the global economy and overcome developmental challenges. Many of theses policies are reflected in the National Economic and Social Development Plans (NESDPs). NESDPs contain detailed indicators and targets that serve as guidelines for government agencies. The investment agencies and the science and technology institutions have played a critical role in the industrialization of Thailand. The investment policy measures developed by the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) promoted Thailand as a favourable destination for export-oriented FDI. These measures were particularly important for investment in the electronics industry. On the other hand, the science and technology policies facilitated transfer of technology and promoted the development of the technological base. Several institutions and ministries addressed areas such as manpower training and education, establishment of incubators and science parks, and provision of grants.  An overview of the evolution of these policies provides a look at some of these government efforts that influenced the development of the manufacturing sector in general and the electronics industry in particular.   1  Overall national development policies  Since 1961, the development policies of Thailand have been reflected in the five-year National Economic and Social Development Plans (NESDPs). NESDPs serve as the main guideline for medium-term economic development and play an important role in directing national development. Each plan contains detailed targets such as economic growth rate, inflation rate, export growth rate and the number of jobs to be created, and how the targets would be achieved. Although the plans are only indicative, the Government strives to achieve the performance indicators contained in the NESDPs.  The first and the second plans (1961-1971) focused on import-substitution policies to promote the local industrial development, attract investment and reduce the current account deficit. The objective of the third plan (1972-1976) was to increase exports as a way of boosting growth in per capita income and employment opportunities. The annual growth rate target was set at 7 per cent. The fourth plan (1976-1982) had the same focus but paid more attention to investment as a tool for employment creation. It set the growth rate at 7.2 per cent annually and aimed at the creation of 2.2 million jobs.  The aim of the fifth plan (1982-1986) was to expand investment flows to the rural areas, while achieving an economic growth rate of 6.6 per cent and export growth rate of 22 per cent. It induced industries to move production bases to the rural area through tax incentives and provision of support infrastructure. This led to the creation of the Eastern Seaboard as an export-processing zone. The sixth plan (1987-1991) saw the rise in exports of Transfer of Technology  6 electronic products and the location of industries in eastern, northern and southern regions of Thailand. The eighth plan (1997-2001) and ninth plan (2002-2006) have placed emphasis on, among other things, human resource development and the role of SMEs in the competitiveness of the nation. The national development plans have played a key role in creating a sound macroeconomic environment and progressively opening up the country. First, having a sound macroeconomic profile enhanced the confidence and trust of foreign investors in the Thai economy. Second, opening up the country created opportunities for export-oriented FDI. The national development plans have been instrumental in integrating Thailand into the global economy and the production networks of TNCs, particularly in the electronics industry. Investment promotion, development of science and technology capabilities and implementation of measures supporting the development of the electronics industry have been important components of the national development strategy as reflected in the NESDPs. For example, the sixth plan (1987-1991) identified software engineering, circuit designs, production management, and computer-aided and mechanical technology as key technologies for the electronics industry. In addition, it recommended strategies to promote investment in manufacturing products with high technology content and to promote support-industries and product design. Specific products of interest included personal computers, mobile phones and facsimiles, among others.   2 Investment promotion policies The Government recognized the importance of FDI in building the national productive and technological base as reflected in the NESDPs. One institution that has played an important role in the development of the electronics industry is the Board of Investment (BOI). BOI is the Thai government agency responsible for investment policy advocacy and its implementation, and investment promotion and facilitation.  BOI is composed of two bodies: the Board and the Office of the Board of Investment. The Board is currently chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and is responsible for formulating policy guidelines and implementing the Investment Promotion Act. The Office of the BOI is the administrative arm that implements the decisions of the Board. BOI works with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry, and has overseas offices in Frankfurt, New York and Paris. BOI provides investors with a wide range of incentives such as exemptions from and/or reduction of import duties, corporate income and other income-related taxes, credit assistance, guarantees, infrastructure support and services. The non-tax incentives (e.g. guarantees) are available to all BOI-promoted projects, regardless of location or industry. Tax-based incentives are location- and/or industry-specific. Over the last four decades, the incentives have evolved from those supporting import-substitution policies to those promoting export growth and encouraging location o</p>
